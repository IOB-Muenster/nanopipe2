Run the nanopipe
========================================================================

To run teh software it should be properly installed, the PATH and
PERL5LIB environmet set and the target folders prepared.

Enter a directory where you want to have a run.  Place following files
inside:

- input.query - the query file with fasta seqences

- input.target - a file containing he target (usually the
  (subdirectory) name what you used in the /path/to/nanopipe/targets
  directory)

- input.lastparams - the parameters for last

  -a 10 -b 4 -A 17 -B 3 -S 1

- input.substmatrix - the substitution matrix like

          A       C       G       T
  A       5       -3      -2      -14
  C       -7      6       -6      -9
  G       -4      -6      6       -14
  T       -14     -9      -8      5

  Note: the value of substmatrix in the config files inside the
  targets folder are not taken, because these values had been used in
  the web application

Then type the command:

# nanopipe_calc.pl -q input.query -t input.target

In the end you will get following files:

cal.tidmap - A file containing the relationship between numbers of
genereted fiiles and the original sequence ids.  To separate between
these was done, because ids can be very colng and contain arbitrary
charaters (maybe).

calc.nuccounts.n - The files containg the nuceotid counts

calc.nuccounts.n.poly - The polymorphism to the nuccounts file

calc.nuccounts.n.help - Not needed here, used for web page display.

calc.consensus.n - The consensus files for the calc.nuccounts.n files

calc.lastalign.maf - the last data
