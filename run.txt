Run the nanopipe
========================================================================

To run the software locally it should be properly installed, the PATH and
PERL5LIB environmet set and the target folders prepared.

Enter a directory where you want to have a run.  Place following files
inside:

- input.query - your query file with seqences

- input.target - a file containing the target (for example, /path/to/nanopipe/targets/your_target)

- input.lastparams - the parameters for last. Usually the parameters are generated by last-train program. 
Here is the default parameters, suitable for the most vertebrate targets. The content of the file:

  -a 10 -b 4 -A 17 -B 3 -S 1

- input.substmatrix - the substitution matrix for last, defined by last-train. The default submatrix file looks like:

          A       C       G       T
  A       5       -3      -2      -14
  C       -7      6       -6      -9
  G       -4      -6      6       -14
  T       -14     -9      -8      5

 
Then type the command:

# nanopipe_calc.pl -q input.query -t input.target

As the result you will get following files:

cal.tidmap - A file containing the relationship between numbers of
genereted fiiles and the original sequence ids.  

calc.nuccounts.n - files with the nuceotide counts

calc.nuccounts.n.poly - polymorphism table, based on 'nuccounts' file

calc.nuccounts.n.help - only for web page display, can not be used locally.

calc.consensus.n - sequence consensus file, based on 'calc.nuccounts.n' files

calc.lastalign.maf - alignment, output file of LAST aligner
