# nanopipe2
NanoPipe analyzes reads generated by the Oxford Nanopore sequencing devices. As a result, it provides alignments to any target of interest, alignment statistics and information about polymorphisms. Originally, NanoPipe is the web-based software. To run it online, please, refer to our lab home page: http://bioinformatics.uni-muenster.de/tools/nanopipe2. If you wish to run the tool locally and modify the code, you can download the script here.
